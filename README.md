## Database
During the development **sqlite3** database was used which is installed with **Django**.

All databases were created by adding to the models.py file in their respective apps then using CLI to make migrations and migrate.

For deployment(production), a PostgreSQL database is provided by Heroku as an add-on.

Fixtures for the products are taken from the **Code Institute** course material and altered
to better fit this project.
