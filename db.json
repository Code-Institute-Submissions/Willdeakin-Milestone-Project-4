This detrimental droop can lead to back pain or, more seriously, herniated disks. Other losses of alignment include the “chicken-pecking” head (where your chin juts forward), shoulders shrugging toward your ears, hips too high in the air or your body tilting to one side or another.\r\n\r\nTHE SOLUTION: \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, ensure you have the strength to hold a strong plank. If lack of strength is an issue, try reducing the load by placing your knees on the ground or elevating your upper body onto a bench, step or TRX suspension trainer. Next, try holding a plank next to a mirror and look for neutral alignment: your ears, shoulders, hips and ankles should all be in a perfect line. If you are still unsure about your alignment, check out this fun Perfect Plank app that watches key points in your body and coaches you into a perfectly aligned plank.\r\n\r\n2 NOT BRACING TIGHT ENOUGH\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM: \r\n\r\nWhen holding a plank, your brain is probably thinking “how long,” instead of “how tight.” A lack of full-body tension can lead to “hanging out” in the joints, which is not only counterproductive but can also leave you at a higher risk for spine and shoulder injury.\r\n\r\nTHE SOLUTION: \r\n\r\nAs you get set into your plank, think of tightening each muscle group one-by-one: calves, quads, hamstrings, glutes, core, shoulders and, finally, your forearms. Other tricks to this full-body stiffness include pressing your heels back and driving your forearms downward and apart. These two actions not only help add tension, but can also improve full-body alignment.\r\n\r\n3 SCAPULAR WINGING\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM:\r\n\r\nRiding the coattails of number 2 on this list is the setback of “scapular winging” or, more simply, letting your shoulder blades and chest collapse downward into the plank.\r\n\r\nTHE SOLUTION: \r\n\r\nThis mistake is another result of “hanging out in the joints,” so you need to be more active in your shoulders. To do so, imagine juicing an orange in each armpit while simultaneously pressing your forearms or hands into the floor.\r\n\r\nIf you’re holding a hand plank position (instead of a forearm plank), pretend you are corkscrewing your hands away from one another, allowing your elbow pits to rotate forward.\r\n\r\nCLICK TO TWEET THIS ARTICLE > Do you know how to hold a plank correctly? Are you sure? Find out on the @myfitnesspal blog. #myfitnesspal\r\n\r\n4 HOLDING THE PLANK TOO LONG\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM:\r\n\r\nThis mistake ties together all the above issues. When you hold a plank too long, your hips tend to sag, body tension is reduced, and your shoulder blades might begin to wing.\r\n\r\nTHE SOLUTION:\r\n\r\nOnce again, throw away the mantra of “how long” and focus on “how tight.” Think of a plank like lifting weights in the gym. You gain so much more from a set of 10 reps with heavier weights (with great form, of course) than a set of 100 reps with a very light weight. The same goes for planking.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Dr. Stuart McGill, a leader in the field of spinal stability and core strength, touts holding planks for no longer than 10 seconds at a time. If you feel you can do more, hold the plank for 10 seconds, take a 2–3 second reset, then press back up and repeat. These shorter, stronger planks lead to safer planking and greater core strength and endurance gains.", "created_on": "2021-10-30T18:12:12.840Z", "status": 1}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 3, "fields": {"title": "5 Tips On How To Reduce Morning Stiffness", "slug": "5-tips-on-how-to-reduce-morning-stiffness", "author": 2, "updated_on": "2021-10-30T18:14:03.088Z", "content": "It’s difficult to entirely eradicate stiffness upon waking, but fortunately, there are steps you can take to mitigate its effects and feel fresher in the morning.\r\n\r\n1 FIND THE RIGHT PILLOW\r\n\r\nYour pillow should match your sleeping style; back sleepers need a different pillow than side or stomach sleepers. But everyone needs a pillow that supports the natural curve of your neck and aligns your head, neck and spine when lying down. This helps you sleep more comfortably, prevents muscle strain and reduces undue soreness the next day. This guide to choosing the right pillow can help.\r\n\r\n2 MOVE MORE THROUGHOUT THE DAY\r\n\r\nYes, exercise can make you sore, but regular exercise keeps your joints lubricated and your muscles strong, which keeps your body feeling better long term. If you can’t make it to the gym (or even if you can), schedule more movement into your day. Those with sedentary jobs should aim to get up from their desks each hour to walk around for a few minutes before sitting back down.\r\n\r\n3 TRY STRESS-RELIEVING MEDITATION OR STRETCHING BEFORE BED\r\n\r\nMeditation is a great stress reliever. And stretching feels good any time of day. But going to bed relaxed can help your mind and body stay relaxed as you sleep. Try a simple stretching routine before bed to relax your muscles, or engage in a short meditation to prep your mind for sound sleep. If you’re still stiff in the morning, wake your body up with a series of stretches to start your day, like hip-openers, cat-cows and child’s pose.\r\n\r\n4 EAT MORE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY FOODS\r\n\r\nAnti-inflammatory diets are flexible and customizable, so while you may need to reduce certain foods, you’ll never have a shortage of delicious things to eat. Load up on berries, vegetables, avocados, fatty fish, hot peppers and nuts, and reduce your consumption of processed meats, refined carbs and sugar. You can still enjoy treats like dark chocolate and wine in moderation. Not only do they taste good, but they’re packed with inflammation-fighting properties.\r\n\r\n5 GET MORE VITAMIN D\r\n\r\nVitamin D — or a lack thereof — is associated with everything from immunity to brain function, but vitamin D’s impact on bone and muscle health can impact your mornings. Increase your levels by getting 10–15 minutes of sunlight each day, eating foods like fatty fish, fortified dairy and egg yolks, or taking a supplement.", "created_on": "2021-10-30T18:14:03.088Z", "status": 1}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 1, "fields": {"post": 1, "name": "willdeakin", "email": "willdeakin@outlook.com", "body": "very good", "created_on": "2021-10-30T10:40:15.979Z", "active": true}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 2, "fields": {"post": 1, "name": "willdeakin", "email": "willdeakin@outlook.com", "body": "not very good", "created_on": "2021-10-30T10:42:10.189Z", "active": false}}, {"model": "blog.comment", "pk": 3, "fields": {"post": 1, "name": "james example", "email": "example@example.com", "body": "this is a test", "created_on": "2021-10-30T15:29:33.623Z", "active": true}}]
